        <h3>The Mission</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    We wish to build an acceptable issue tracking system that makes us
<br>

    have to deal with our own software.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    It is <b>not</b> to build a better bug tracker than any in the field
<br>

    (though we like it).

        <h3>What Do I Get Out of It?</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    While our goals don&#39;t involve making the best bug tracker ever, we&#39;ve
<br>

    actually found in practice that it&#39;s quite nice to use.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    There are lots of reasons you might want to come on board.
  </p>
  

  <ul>
  
    <li>it&#39;s faster</li>
  
    <li>it&#39;s easier to use</li>
  
    <li>it&#39;s streamlined around our needs</li>
  
    <li>you can help us all build better products</li>
  
  </ul>

        <h3>Reaching Out</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    How low can we get the bar to having users engage?
  </p>

  <ul>
  
    <li>People can file bugs/comment via email</li>
  
    <li>XMPP, IRC, etc...?</li>
  
    <li>People can even file bugs in cbugg from github&#39;s issues tool (even pull requests)</li>
  
  </ul>

        <h3>Bringing People In</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    You can ask for someone&#39;s input on a bug without harassing them in
<br>

    general, and that action is visible to everyone so a user doesn&#39;t have
<br>

    to get a ton of duplicate emails from people pointing them to a URL.

        <h3>...Even Yourself</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    And if the you&#39;re not ready to work on something, you can ask cbugg to
<br>

    send you an email when you think you might be ready.

        <h3>Finding Duplicates</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    Instead of searching before you start to file a bug, just file it.
<br>

    Our ElasticSearch integration will immediately help you find out if
<br>

    someone else has seen your issue.
