Why would I want to use cbugg?

* The Mission

We wish to build an acceptable issue tracking system that makes us
have to deal with our own software.

It is *not* to build a better bug tracker than any in the field
(though we like it).

* What Do I Get Out of It?

While our goals don't involve making the best bug tracker ever, we've
actually found in practice that it's quite nice to use.

There are lots of reasons you might want to come on board.

- it's faster
- it's easier to use
- it's streamlined around our needs
- you can help us all build better products

* Reaching Out

How low can we get the bar to having users engage?

- People can file bugs/comment via email
- XMPP, IRC, etc...?
- People can even file bugs in cbugg from github's issues tool

* Bringing People In

You can ask for someone's input on a bug without harassing them in
general, and that action is visible to everyone so a user doesn't have
to get a ton of duplicate emails from people pointing them to a URL.

* ...Even Yourself

And if the you're not ready to work on something, you can ask cbugg to
send you an email when you think you might be ready.

* Finding Duplicates

Instead of searching before you start to file a bug, just file it.
Our ElasticSearch integration will immediately help you find out if
someone else has seen your issue.
