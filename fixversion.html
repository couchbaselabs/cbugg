        <h3>Keeping it Simple</h3>
        
  <ul>
  
    <li>File a bug.</li>
  
    <li>Submit a fix.</li>
  
    <li>Use data to keep track of where all the fix propagates.</li>
  
    <li>Discard assumptions.</li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    For best results, also identify the change that introduced the bug.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    (if the bug has &#34;always been there&#34; that&#39;s also valid)

        <h3>Fix Version?</h3>
        
  
  <p>
    There are simple cases we see <i>today</i> where a &#34;fix version&#34; is misleading.
  </p>

</div>

  
  <p>
    The fixes for &#34;x&#34; and &#34;y&#34; both were committed and put in place
<br>

    <b>before</b> 2.1 was released.  The 2.0.1 release included the fix for &#34;y&#34;
<br>

    and the 2.1 release came after 2.0.1, but did not include the fix for &#34;y&#34;

        <h3>...but it gets more complicated</h3>
        
  <ul>
  
    <li>A bug may require changes to multiple projects.</li>
  
    <li><i>Part</i> of the fix may be merged in one project, but not another.</li>
  
    <li>A bad merge can reintroduce the bug even after the fix is merged.</li>
  
    <li>A bug may not exist <i>before</i> a particular version on a stability branch.</li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    What is the &#34;fix version&#34;?

        <h3>Better Questions</h3>
        
  <ul>
  
    <li>What builds contain bug y?</li>
  
    <li>What bugs are known to be in release 2.1?</li>
  
    <li>What builds contain fixes for <b>both</b> bugs x and y?</li>
  
  </ul>

  
  <p>
    In reality, we capture data that tells us this.
  </p>
  

  
  <p>
    Tracking changes and asking the exact questions we want to know will
<br>

    yieldbetter results and things will be consistent --
<br>

    <i>even when we make procedural mistakes</i>.
